# What?

Point `latexsnapshots` to your git repo, and it will go through the commits and identify those that change your tex files in a significant way,
and regenerate the pdf files.  It will also take thumbnails of those pdfs, and show them in a web UI.

Install it

        pip install latexsnapshots

## Live Demo

See the output of the `export` command here [http://www.eugenewu.net/latexsnapshots/html/](http://www.eugenewu.net/latexsnapshots/html/)

# Usage

* Create a config file (below)
* Generate snapshots of your latex document.  The code currently creates a snapshot every time
  the Levenshtein distance between the `*.tex` documents is greater than a configurable distancte,
  and when it's been more than X hours since the last snapshotted commit.

  * Note that `latexsnapshots` will create a sqlite database file based on your config file to store metadata about the snapshots.  
    The `dburi` path is relative to your current directory.
* Run the server to see thumbnails of your snapshots.  You can run this while `latexsnapshots latex` is running

        latexsnapshots server

* Export everything into a folder for deployment as static website: [See example](http://eugenewu.net/latexsnapshots/html/)

        mkdir outputdir
        latexsnapshots export -o outputdir


# Create a config file

Create a python file called [config.py](config.py) in your current directory.  `latexsnapshots` will look in your current
directory to import this file.
